angular js example

Time spent: 9hrs ( 3 research and 6 actual work)

3hrs reading up and playing with angular
2hrs markup
2hrs github login (angular learning curve!)
1hr  search functionality and relating functionality
1hr overriding some bootstrap responsive things.

If I'd known angular before doing this i think i would've got a lot more
done.  I would have done the right gutter in a much better way (I hate the 
way i left that) and I would've adhered to the css specifics more closely.

I now know i could've done all of this without the use of bootstrap js and 
jquery so would do it without next time.
